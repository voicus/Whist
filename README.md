### Epic Story
This is an online **Romanian Whist Multiplayer Game** made with `Go` (backend) and `HTML, CSS & JS` (frontend). The app allows people to register and login in order to keep track of the individual information (score, friend list, etc.). Everyone logged in has the possibility to either create a lobby or join an available lobby in order to play the game with another 3 players, as well as see the game rules within the app. Have fun with your friends and try to get the highest score of all players. :)
